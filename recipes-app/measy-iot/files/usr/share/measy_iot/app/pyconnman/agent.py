    This method gets called when trying to connect to

    example a passphrase or the name of a hidden network.

    The return value should be a dictionary where the
    keys are the field names and the values are the
    actual fields. Alternatively an error indicating that
    the request got canceled can be returned.

    Most common return field names are "Name" and of
    course "Passphrase".

    The dictionary arguments contains field names with
    their input parameters.

    In case of WISPr credentials requests and if the user
    prefers to login through the browser by himself, agent
    will have to return a LaunchBrowser error (see below).

    :Examples:

    1. Requesting a passphrase for WPA2 network

                }

            --> { "Username" : "foo", "Password": "secret" }

    :param: string path:
        Object path of service object making the request
    :param: dict fields:
        Allowed field names follow:
        * Type(string):
            Contains the type of a field. For example "psk", "wep"
            "passphrase", "response", "ssid", "wpspin" or plain
            "string".
        * Requirement(string):
            Contains the requirement option. Valid values are
            "mandatory", "optional", "alternate" or
            "informational".

            The "alternate" value specifies that this field can be
            returned as an alternative to another one. An example
            would be the network name or SSID.

            All "mandatory" fields must be returned, while the
            "optional" can be returned if available.

            Nothing needs to be returned for "informational", as it
            is here only to provide an information so a value is
            attached to it.
        * Alternates(array{string}):
            Contains the list of alternate field names this
            field can be represented by.
        * Value(string):
            Contains data as a string, relatively to an
            "informational" argument.

    :return: Allowed field names are:
        * Name(string):
            The name of a network. This field will be requested
            when trying to connect to a hidden network.
        * SSID(array{byte}):
            This field is an alternative to "Name" for WiFi
            networks and can be used to return the exact binary
            representation of a network name.

            Normally returning the "Name" field is the better
            option here.
        * Identity(string):
            Identity (username) for EAP authentication methods.
        * Passphrase(string):
            The passphrase for authentication. For example a WEP
            key, a PSK passphrase or a passphrase for EAP
            authentication methods.
        * PreviousPassphrase(string):
            The previous passphrase successfully saved, i.e.
            which lead to a successfull connection. This field is
            provided as an informational argument when connecting
            with it does not work anymore, for instance when it
            has been changed on the AP. Such argument appears when
            a RequestInput is raised after a retry. In case of WPS
            association through PIN method: when retrying, the
            previous wpspin will be provided.
        * WPS(string):
            This field requests the use of WPS to get associated.
            This is an alternate choice against Passphrase when
            requested service supports WPS. The reply can contain
            either empty pin, if user wants to use push-button
            method, or a pin code if user wants to use the pin
            method.
        * Username(string):
            Username for WISPr authentication. This field will be
            requested when connecting to a WISPr-enabled hotspot.
        * Password(string):
            Password for WISPr authentication. This field will be
            requested when connecting to a WISPr-enabled hotspot.
