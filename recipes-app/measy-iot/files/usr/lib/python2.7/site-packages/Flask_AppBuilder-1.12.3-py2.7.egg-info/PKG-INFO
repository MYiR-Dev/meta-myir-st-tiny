        Simple and rapid application development framework, built on top of `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_.
        includes detailed security, auto CRUD generation for your models, google charts and much more.
        
        Extensive configuration of all functionality, easily integrate with normal Flask/Jinja2 development.
        
        Take a look at installation, quick how to tutorials, API reference etc: `Documentation <http://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

        Package Version
        ---------------
        
        *New 1.12.2*.
        
        BREAKING CHANGES relative to 1.12.0: we have bumped flask-login version, this causes breaking changes on the API relative to this package.
        
        - Flask-AppBuilder version <= 1.11.1 was using Flask-Login 0.2.X.
        
        - Flask-AppBuilder version > 1.12.0 is using Flask-Login > 0.3.X.
        
        The following methods from Flask-Login changed to properties:
        
        - is_anonymous() -> is_anonymous
        
        - is_active() -> is_active
        
        - is_authenticated() -> is_authenticated
        
        Take at look at: https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/master/CHANGES#L49
        
        Also read the `Versions <http://flask-appbuilder.readthedocs.org/en/latest/versions.html>`_ for further detail on what changed.
